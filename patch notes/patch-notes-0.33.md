## Stellar View
[CurseForge Link](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/stellarview)

### Stellar View 1.20.1 - 0.2.3 Hotfix
#### Fixes:

*   Fixed galaxy API problems that can cause crashes related to compatibility
*   Fixed galaxy rotation being incorrectly affected by the year length config slider

### Stellar View 1.20.1 - 0.2.3
#### HUGE thanks to Noobly Walker who practically carried most this update

#### Added:

*   Added a bunch of famous moons and some dwarf planets (don't question how you're able to see them with just a spyglass)
*   Added star spectral classes - Stars are now divided into distinct spectral classes (O, B, A, F, G, K, M) which dictate their size and brightness and are by default distributed based on real life (most stars are M-class), the distribution can be made uniform in the config
*   Added multiple meteor shower colors
*   Added a bunch of config settings for how stars appear

#### Changes:

*   Stars now lose brightness with distance, giving a more 3D feel to the Milky Way galaxy
*   Minimal distance at which Z sky axis is rotated by 90 degrees has been changed from 100 000 blocks to 10 000 blocks
*   Year length is now configurable

#### Fixes:

*   The Moon's phases should now properly line up with where it is in the sky

## The Aether: Redux
[CurseForge Link](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/aether-redux)

### v2.0.15 (1.20.1)
OOOKAY... the crashing should be fixed now hopefully!  
This update *also* adds compat with the new official Aether addons!

CHANGELOG:

+ Aether: Treasure Reforging compatibility! + Aether: Protect Your Moa compatibility! - Removed embedding of the extra dependencies that was added in 2.0.14, will reevaluate for 2.1 and potentiallyk bring it back if I can get it to work right > Fixed crashing due to dependency conflicts and geckolib stuff

### v2.0.14b (1.20.1)
ANOTHER update! This one fixes a crash, along with a few miscellaneous issues.

CHANGELOG:

> Fixed game crash due to mixin issues > Leaf Piles will now drop when using shears, consistent with leaf blocks. > Other blocks that could previously be obtained with shears now can also be obtained with Silk Touch

### v2.0.14 (1.20.1)
New update! This one brings a few small changes, plus a removal of something unfortunately. Luckily, it wasn't even enabled by defult, and removing it just makes the code a bit more stable.

CHANGELOG:

- Removed Classic Skyfields config option * ALL dependencies (apart from the Aether) are now bundled with the mod, so no extra downloads other than the Aether itself are necessary. > Fixes to the recent Moa and Cockatrice model changes > Fixed unused Skysprouts crop still existing ingame

### v2.0.13 (1.20.1)
2.0.13 is here! This one brings a variety of fixes and improvements, including a modified Moa design, using a hybrid of the current one and the new unfinished one coming in 2.1!

CHANGELOG:

* Changed Moa and Cockatrice models, these changes can be reverted in the client config * Swets now need to be slightly larger to damage the player, although they can still move the player at the same size; this may be tweaked further in the future > Fixed boulders spawning in random locations where they shouldn't > Fixed Mykapods having 20 health points (the same amount as the player) > Fixed Valkyrie Rings dropping in stacks when using looting > Other misc looting-related loot fixes > [1.19.2] Fixed leaf loot tables crashing the game > Fixed issue with the All Bark, All Bite mod and the moa/cockatrice models > Fixed a small Ancient Aether compat issue relating to Festive Swets

## Amendments
