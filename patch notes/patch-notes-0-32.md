## YetAnotherConfigLib
[CurseForge Link](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/yacl)

### YetAnotherConfigLib 3.4.2 for MC 1.20.1

This build supports the following versions:

*   Fabric 1.20.1
*   Fabric 1.20.4
*   Fabric 1.20.5
*   Forge 1.20.1
*   NeoForge 1.20.4

Bug Fixes
---------

*   Fix YACL breaking fabric reload listener dependency order

Translation Updates
-------------------

*   Added colour picker translations for Tatar ([#174](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/pull/174))

---------

*   Fix conflict with Crowdin Translate

### YetAnotherConfigLib 3.4.0 for MC 1.20.1
YetAnotherConfigLib 3.4.0
=========================

This build supports the following versions:

*   Fabric 1.20.1
*   Fabric 1.20.4
*   Fabric 1.20.5
*   Forge 1.20.1
*   NeoForge 1.20.4

For developers...
-----------------

This is the first build which uses a new build toolchain to support multiple minecraft versions in the same codebase. With this change, the artifact of the mod has changed.

    modImplementation "dev.isxander:yet-another-config-lib:{modversion}+{mcversion}-{loader}"
    // for example...
    modImplementation "dev.isxander:yet-another-config-lib:3.4.0+1.20.1-fabric"
    

If you are using YACL in an architectury project (one with a common subproject), you will from now on depend on the fabric version of YACL. There is no longer any common artifact. I don't believe there to be any issues with doing it like this.

Additions
---------

*   New colour picker widget by [Superkat32](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/pull/140)
    *   This works with existing colour options.

![Colour picker example](https://i.imgur.com/G6Yx6RU.png)

*   Added a custom tab API so categories can provide their own GUI, instead of YACL options.
    *   Mod developers can make their category class implement `CustomTabProvider`. Javadoc is available.
*   Add a new Kotlin DSL for creating your YACL UIs. This is a wrapper on top of the java builder interface providing extra functionality for Kotlin users.
    *   YACL does not provide any kotlin libraries, nor does it depend on them. If you would like to use this DSL, make sure your own mod depends on your loader's Kotlin mod.
    *   This is included in the main artifact. You don't need additional dependencies.
    *   An example usage can be found [in the testmod](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/blob/multiversion/dev/src/testmod/kotlin/dev/isxander/yacl3/test/DslTest.kt)
*   Improved the backend of dropdown controllers by [Crendgrim](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/pull/162)

Bug Fixes
---------

*   Fix GIFs not being preloaded in the resource reloader

**The Config Update**

*   Added a proper config to the mod version at `config/tectonic.json`, with three categories to play around with.
    *   Legacy: Controls the legacy mode, which was introduced earlier in v2.1 to allow safe upgrading of Tectonic v1 worlds.
    *   Features: Allows some features of the mod to be toggled on and off. This includes deeper oceans, underground rivers, lava rivers, and desert dunes.
    *   Experimental: Adds some extra configuration options just for fun. It includes the following:
        *   An increased height setting, which will increase the overworld's build and generation limits to y640.
        *   A terrain scale setting, which will vertically scale the terrain by a given factor. Combined with the increased height setting, you can make mountains stretch to over 500 blocks tall.
        *   A horizontal mountain scale setting, which horizontally scales mountains (how shocking). This can make mountains thicker and more spread out.
    *   On top of these three categories, there's a setting for if the mod is enabled. Tectonic will lie dormant and not affect the game if this is turned on.

There's been a lot of backend work going on to make the update possible. As a result, there's been some merges and splits of mod jars.

1.  The multi-loader 1.20.1 and 1.19.2 versions have been split into separate Fabric and Forge versions.
    
2.  The Fabric 1.19.3-1.20.1 and Fabric 1.20.2+ versions have been merged into a single version.
    

*   When deeper oceans are enabled, ocean monuments will generate 30 blocks lower than in vanilla.
*   Fixed an issue where Badlands biomes above y256 were covered in Orange Terracotta.
*   Reworked desert dune generation to be a lot more common and more "dune-y".

### v2.3 ~ Forge 1.19.3-1.20.1

### v2.2.1 ~ Forge 1.20.2
**Several fixes!**

*   Fixed Large Biomes/Superflat not functioning (All mod versions)
*   Fixed Forge 1.20.2+ crashing on startup
*   Fixed an issue with hardcoded seeds (again) on Forge 1.18.2
*   Tweaked oceanside cliff generation
    *   Even less snow should generate than before. There's still a very small amount, which is fixed if you have Lithostitched installed.
    *   Cliffs generally will generally stop closer to oceans, preventing too much land biome "spilling" into ocean terrain
    *   In addition to the previous change, ocean biomes will generate farther into cliffs near sea level, further reducing spillage
    *   The bottom layer of cliff carving has been raised, preventing weirdness with ocean biome terrain generating higher than where cliffs carved down to
    *   Steep cliffs similar to the ones in vanilla will also generate alongside the "carved" cliffs
*   Signficantly reduced the amount of Lush Caves leaking onto the surface near underground river entrances
*   Removed invalid license file (All mod versions)
*   Removed discord link (All fabric versions)

## [EMF] Entity Model Features [Fabric & Forge]
[CurseForge Link](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/entity-model-features)

### entity_model_features_forge_1.20.1-2.0.2.jar
2.0.2

*   fixed the first person hand settings not getting reset correctly in 2.0.1
*   added the `is_swinging_right_arm` & `is_swinging_left_arm` boolean variables, used to distinguish right and left arm swinging in biped models, if no arm is swinging both should be false, if `swing_progress > 0` then one of these should be true.
*   added support for an optional `player_cape.jem` model file to be used for better animating the player cape `player_cape.jem` only contains a `cloak` part, positioned exactly as it is in the regular `player.jem`, if this model is present it will render in a special way that will not apply the vanilla animations to the cape. Allowing much easier custom animations _(note this jem file can not be exported by the EMF config, but the `player.jem` exported model will work perfectly for it, as of v2.0.2)_

The only transforms EMF applies to `player_cape.jem` before rendering & custom animating is:

*   rotating the cape 180 degrees around the `y` axis. (matching vanilla)
*   translating the cape 2 pixels backwards. (matching vanilla)
*   translating the cape a further 1 pixel backwards & upwards if the player has a chest-plate on. (matching vanilla)

No other rotations or translations are applied to the cape, allowing for fully custom animations.

The `cloak` part inside the regular `player.jem` will render if `player_cape.jem` is not present, but will not benefit from having its vanilla animation cancelled by EMF

### entity_model_features_forge_1.20.4-2.0.1.jar
*   added `is_first_person_hand` variable to detect then the model part being rendered is the first person player hand
*   added the `player settings` category in the model settings gui
    *   added a setting to force custom player models to only apply to your own player and not others in multiplayer
    *   added a setting to forcibly prevent all custom hand animations from playing in first person view
    *   both are disabled by default
*   fixed the `is_sneaking` variable not working correctly, should now line up with all models that have a sneaking pose
*   added missing variables to the animation docs
*   fixed block entities, and some other edge cases, with texture overrides in the model not rendering at all

### entity_model_features_forge_1.20.2-2.0.1.jar
*   added `is_first_person_hand` variable to detect then the model part being rendered is the first person player hand
*   added the `player settings` category in the model settings gui
    *   added a setting to force custom player models to only apply to your own player and not others in multiplayer
    *   added a setting to forcibly prevent all custom hand animations from playing in first person view
    *   both are disabled by default
*   fixed the `is_sneaking` variable not working correctly, should now line up with all models that have a sneaking pose
*   added missing variables to the animation docs
*   fixed block entities, and some other edge cases, with texture overrides in the model not rendering at all

### entity_model_features_forge_1.20.1-2.0.1.jar
*   added `is_first_person_hand` variable to detect then the model part being rendered is the first person player hand
*   added the `player settings` category in the model settings gui
    *   added a setting to force custom player models to only apply to your own player and not others in multiplayer
    *   added a setting to forcibly prevent all custom hand animations from playing in first person view
    *   both are disabled by default
*   fixed the `is_sneaking` variable not working correctly, should now line up with all models that have a sneaking pose
*   added missing variables to the animation docs
*   fixed block entities, and some other edge cases, with texture overrides in the model not rendering at all

### entity_model_features_forge_1.20.4-2.0.jar
*   texture overrides now give the `missing texture` texture if the texture wasn't found instead of not applying
    
*   fixed first person hand jittering with certain player animation resource-packs
    
*   added the `ifb() randomb() catch()` animation functions
    
    *   `ifb()` is a boolean returning version of `if()`
    *   `randomb()` is a boolean returning version of `random()`
    *   `catch(x, c, id)` is a new debug function that will always return `x` unless it had an error in which case it will return `c`. `id` is optional and will make the function print the reason `c` was returned to the log with this `id` to identify the printout
*   added the `is_jumping` `is_swimming` `is_gliding` `is_right_handed` animation variables
    
*   added the `modelRule modelSuffix var varb global_var global_varb` random properties
    
*   removed the restriction on entity variables making them only accessible from the declaring model _(OptiFine parity)_ _(wolf_collar.jem can now correctly access variables set by wolf.jem on the same wolf)_
    
*   added a model display to the model list in the gui to see the model before exporting its .jem file
    
*   added attachment points
    
*   added arrow & spectral_arrow model support
    
*   added new model parts listed in `OptiFine 1.20.4_HD_U_I8_pre3`
    
*   added variables `distance` `is_blocking` `is_crawling` `height_above_ground` `fluid_depth` `fluid_depth_down` `fluid_depth_up`
    
*   added Global variables, they are specified in the format "global_var.<name>" (float) or "global_varb.<name>" (boolean), they are shared by all mobs and block entities and allow more technical things like counting entities
    
*   improved rule_index, now correctly applies 0 when no rule is met
    
*   fixed the `cannot inherit from final class` forge crash returning in v1.3
    
*   moved the variant property into ETF
    
*   fixed crash `.jem failed to load java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot read the array length because "textureSize" is null`
    
*   added the model file name to crash messages where it was missing
    
*   added `sizeAdd` to the emf model exporting
    
*   the emf model exporting now does 2 export log passes for each model with known OptiFine part names, one pass with, and one without the OptiFine part names. The one without might reveal some extra parts, that do not get used by OptiFine, or have been added by mods
    
*   EMF model part boxes may now additionally declare `sizeAddX sizeAddY sizeAddZ`, as opposed to just `sizeAdd` with OptiFine, for per axis model inflation. `sizeAdd` will still work as before, though will be overridden if the others are present.
    
*   added OptiFine part name definitions for `breeze`, `breeze_eyes`, `breeze_wind`, `wind_charge`
    
*   fixed case where "!(arms.visible)" works but "!arms.visible" doesn't in 1.3
    
*   the directory format for modded models has been changed from `assets/minecraft/optifine/cem/modded/<namespace>/<modelname>.jem` to `assets/<namespace>/optifine/cem/<modelname>.jem`
    
    *   the old directory with the /modded/ folder is still supported for now but is considered deprecated
    *   this change makes things more consistent with modded name spaces
    *   the `emf/cem/` directory is also valid in these namespaces as well as the ability to put the `<modelname>.jem` file within a folder of the same name, such as `cem/<modelname>/<modelname>.jem`
*   added a setting for the animation distance LOD setting, to now factor in an entities size to affect larger entities less
    
*   fixed a crash when methods were directly inverted e.g `!between(....)`
    
*   failed animation expressions will now resolve to `0` when applied to a model part or variable _(OptiFine parity)_
    
*   supports ETF's new config screen builder
    
    *   added a category `Animation math details` which lists and explains all functions and variables registered to the animation math system
    *   added a category `All models` which allows applying certain settings per .jem file as well as selectively disable the loading of certain models
    *   moved a few settings, mostly for the distance LOD, into the new category `performance settings`
    *   added settings into the `per entity settings` category to allows applying certain settings to only those entities

### entity_model_features_forge_1.20.2-2.0.jar
*   texture overrides now give the `missing texture` texture if the texture wasn't found instead of not applying
    
*   fixed first person hand jittering with certain player animation resource-packs
    
*   added the `ifb() randomb() catch()` animation functions
    
    *   `ifb()` is a boolean returning version of `if()`
    *   `randomb()` is a boolean returning version of `random()`
    *   `catch(x, c, id)` is a new debug function that will always return `x` unless it had an error in which case it will return `c`. `id` is optional and will make the function print the reason `c` was returned to the log with this `id` to identify the printout
*   added the `is_jumping` `is_swimming` `is_gliding` `is_right_handed` animation variables
    
*   added the `modelRule modelSuffix var varb global_var global_varb` random properties
    
*   removed the restriction on entity variables making them only accessible from the declaring model _(OptiFine parity)_ _(wolf_collar.jem can now correctly access variables set by wolf.jem on the same wolf)_
    
*   added a model display to the model list in the gui to see the model before exporting its .jem file
    
*   added attachment points
    
*   added arrow & spectral_arrow model support
    
*   added new model parts listed in `OptiFine 1.20.4_HD_U_I8_pre3`
    
*   added variables `distance` `is_blocking` `is_crawling` `height_above_ground` `fluid_depth` `fluid_depth_down` `fluid_depth_up`
    
*   added Global variables, they are specified in the format "global_var.<name>" (float) or "global_varb.<name>" (boolean), they are shared by all mobs and block entities and allow more technical things like counting entities
    
*   improved rule_index, now correctly applies 0 when no rule is met
    
*   fixed the `cannot inherit from final class` forge crash returning in v1.3
    
*   moved the variant property into ETF
    
*   fixed crash `.jem failed to load java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot read the array length because "textureSize" is null`
    
*   added the model file name to crash messages where it was missing
    
*   added `sizeAdd` to the emf model exporting
    
*   the emf model exporting now does 2 export log passes for each model with known OptiFine part names, one pass with, and one without the OptiFine part names. The one without might reveal some extra parts, that do not get used by OptiFine, or have been added by mods
    
*   EMF model part boxes may now additionally declare `sizeAddX sizeAddY sizeAddZ`, as opposed to just `sizeAdd` with OptiFine, for per axis model inflation. `sizeAdd` will still work as before, though will be overridden if the others are present.
    
*   added OptiFine part name definitions for `breeze`, `breeze_eyes`, `breeze_wind`, `wind_charge`
    
*   fixed case where "!(arms.visible)" works but "!arms.visible" doesn't in 1.3
    
*   the directory format for modded models has been changed from `assets/minecraft/optifine/cem/modded/<namespace>/<modelname>.jem` to `assets/<namespace>/optifine/cem/<modelname>.jem`
    
    *   the old directory with the /modded/ folder is still supported for now but is considered deprecated
    *   this change makes things more consistent with modded name spaces
    *   the `emf/cem/` directory is also valid in these namespaces as well as the ability to put the `<modelname>.jem` file within a folder of the same name, such as `cem/<modelname>/<modelname>.jem`

### entity_model_features_forge_1.20.4-1.3.jar
*   added the `EMFAnimationApi` which allows other mods to register their own custom animation variables and functions to EMF
    *   variables can be added to the `EMFAnimationApi`
        *   via a `FloatSupplier` for simple number variables
        *   via a `BooleanSupplier` for simple boolean variables
        *   via a custom variable factory if your variable requires more complex logic, such as reading complex variable names or giving different results for different contexts
    *   functions can be added to the `EMFAnimationApi`
        *   via a `Function<Float, Float>` for simple functions witn 1 argument
        *   via a `BiFunction<Float, Float, Float>` for simple functions with 2 arguments
        *   via a `TriFunction<Float, Float, Float, Float>` for simple functions with 3 arguments
        *   via a `Function<List<Float>, Float>` for functions with a variable amount of arguments provided via a List<Float>
        *   via a custom function factory if your function requires more complex logic, such as reading the argument strings as a value other than float
*   changed the `unknown model printing` option to `Model exporting` and added options to export all models info to a .jem file or the log, not just the unknown / modded ones
    *   Models now export `Blockbench` ready with correct pivots, boxes, and uvs.
    *   models now export to `.minecraft/emf/export/`
*   implemented `is_on_head`, `is_in_hand` & `is_in_item_frame`, which did nothing before
*   fixed a `"newstate" is null` crash
*   added the `Animation LOD distance` setting which allows you to set the distance at which EMF will start skipping animation frames to save performance
*   added the `Retain LOD at low fps` setting which will proportionally reduce the impact of the above LOD setting while the game is running at below 60 fps, as skipped frames can become more noticeable at lower fps
*   reworked the config screen to use sliders where appropriate
*   added `wolf_armor` to the OptiFine name mappings
*   invalid texture overrides will no longer cause the model to fail to load but instead log an error and use the vanilla texture
*   EMF log messages are now prefixed with a shorter `[EMF]`
*   temporarily disabled texture overrides with tridents as they are broken and difficult to troubleshoot
*   added debug render option `Wireframe over texture` which renders both the wireframe and texture of a model together at the same time
*   added debug render option `Wireframe flashing over texture` which renders both the wireframe and texture of a model together at the same time but the wireframe fades in and out
*   emf now correctly reads all texture overrides with the various relative paths set by optifine e.g. `./`, `~/` etc
*   added a config setting _(enabled by default)_ that allows EMF to modify the `enhanced block entity (EBE)` mod's config to disable it for block entities that have custom EMF models loaded
*   fixed texture overrides acting weird with feature renderers _(fixes Ewan's entity health bars cem models with villagers)_
*   added `left_ear` & `right_ear` to `head_piglin.jem` which seems to be correct but missing in OptiFine's documentation :/
*   reduced and reworded some of the loading log spam that would worry users _(for example Fresh Animations 1.9 now sends no log errors on load)_
*   added EMF only rotational logic functions for radians and degrees `wrapdeg() wraprad() degdiff() raddiff()`
    *   the `wrap` functions will wrap a rotation value down to it's smallest identical value, e.g. `wrapdeg(370)` will return `10` & `wrapdeg(350)` will return `-10`
    *   the `diff` functions will return the resulting difference between two rotation values factoring in the rotation, e.g. `degdiff(10, 350)` will return `-20` & `degdiff(10, 370)` will return `0`
*   added very many EMF only interpolation animation functions
    *   `catmullrom() quadbezier() cubicbezier() hermite() easeinoutexpo() easeinexpo() easeoutexpo() easeinoutcirc() easeincirc() easeoutcirc() easeinoutelastic() easeinelastic() easeoutelastic() easeinoutback() easeinback() easeoutback() easeinoutbounce() easeinbounce() easeoutbounce() easeinquad() easeoutquad() easeinoutquad() easeincubic() easeoutcubic() easeinoutcubic() easeinquart() easeoutquart() easeinoutquart() easeinquint() easeoutquint() easeinoutquint() easeinsine() easeoutsine() easeinoutsine()`
    *   hermite & catmullrom have 5 args, the bezier's have 4, the rest have 3, and all are used in the same way as `lerp()` with the delta value being the first argument.
    *   this is a good website to get an idea on what most of these look like [https://easings.net/](/linkout?remoteUrl=https%253a%252f%252feasings.net%252f)
*   `e` variable added
*   fixes for a certain mixin causing crashes
*   EMF now supports modifying modded block entity models which use the vanilla block entity models separately from the vanilla ones
    *   _(e.g. the `lootr` mod's chest now tries to read `modded/lootr/special_loot_chest.jem` instead of conflicting with `chest.jem`)_
    *   enabling the "print unknown models" setting will print out these examples to the log
*   completely rewrote the creation of animation Variables and Functions this should reduce memory usage and also allows other mods to add their own variables and functions
*   reworded some of the translations

## Diagonal Windows [Forge & Fabric]
[CurseForge Link](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/diagonal-windows)

### [FORGE] [1.20.1] DiagonalWindows-v8.1.4
Changelog
=========

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](/linkout?remoteUrl=https%253a%252f%252fkeepachangelog.com%252fen%252f1.0.0%252f).

[v8.1.4-1.20.1] - 2024-03-29
------------------------------

*   Bump bundled Diagonal Blocks mod to v8.0.5

[v8.1.3-1.20.1] - 2023-11-29
------------------------------

*   Updated Diagonal Blocks to v8.0.3

[v8.1.2-1.20.1] - 2023-10-29
------------------------------

### Changed

*   Updated to Puzzles Lib v8.1.5

[v8.1.1-1.20.1] - 2023-10-28
------------------------------

### Fixed

*   Fixed dynamic data generation failing on Windows systems, leading to missing models on Fabric and a crash during start-up on Forge
*   Fixed targeting blocks with new block state properties which cannot be properly supported

[v8.1.0-1.20.1] - 2023-10-27
------------------------------

**BREAKING UPDATE:** All diagonal connections from existing blocks will disappear. The blocks need to be replaced for them to show again.

### Changed

*   No longer applies patches to vanilla blocks, instead a new custom block is dynamically added for every block that is to be made diagonal
*   Players will not notice a difference as there is no new item or crafting recipe, everything works just as it did on the user-side
*   Overhauled connection block state updates, recalculates changes much more efficiently now
*   Performance improvements for constructing shapes
*   Other blocks intersecting with a diagonal connection will now prevent it from forming

### Fixed

*   Fixed block state mismatches when joining a server without the mod installed
*   Fixed log spam for incompatible block state models, every block will only be logged once at most

[v8.0.1-1.20.1] - 2023-07-23
------------------------------

### Fixed

*   Fixed an issue where stained-glass panes generated as part of structures would have incorrectly configured diagonal block states

[v8.0.0-1.20.1] - 2023-07-20
------------------------------

*   Initial release

CHANGELOG:

> Fixed crashing with development versions of Ancient Aether's next update + Reimplemented previously removed Ancient Aether plant tint compat that will be removed Ancient Aether's next update, in a way that avoids crashing + [1.19.2] Implemented Skyroot Chests for dungeon generation, does not do anything with Ascended Quark installed as the mod may add this for their skyroot chests at some point

CHANGELOG:

* Improved Glacia Leaves texture * Increased 'Crazy Cow' easter egg chance slightly (1/100 -> 1/20) - Removed soon-to-be-removed flowers from Ancient Aether grass tint support > Fixed a creative tab issue * Improved Grass placement logic

### [APRIL FOOLS] UPDATE -Œ©.001 !!
THE AETHER: REDUX - CHANGELOG FOR THE NEW VERSION -Œ©.001 !!

We‚Ñ¢ have released the Aether: Redux's new version, Update -Œ©.001 (aka Update Negative Omega Point Zero Zero One or Update Omega) which overhauls the whole mod! again!!1

In fact, this update is SO good, We‚Ñ¢ have scrapped version 2.1 and replaced it with this absolutely amazing update that definitely is not at all related to the current date in Our‚Ñ¢ timezone.

We‚Ñ¢ in fact may never need to release an update again and the mod has definitely Ceased Development (trademark pending).

Have fun with this absolute *BEST* Minecraft Mod Update Ever¬π ‚ÄºÔ∏è

1: Note that We‚Ñ¢ can not reasonably confirm nor deny this statement, and We‚Ñ¢ are not liable for any or all Events of Catastrophic Nature (ECNs) that occur because of the lack of evidence backing this up.

**Some of the notable features in this update include:**

- A new dungeon, known as the Lobotium Dungeon, which We‚Ñ¢ think fits very nicely into the Aether‚Äôs aesthetic. We‚Ñ¢ just hope it is not too unsightreadable.

- A complete rework of the Blight biome, which We‚Ñ¢ deemed to scary and dark previously, so it has been rebranded as the UnBlight, a friendly biome filled with nice and peaceful mobs that want nothing more than to be your friend, such as the newly peace-ified Goodbunny, and its friend the Friendatrice. Speaking of which, We‚Ñ¢ have reverted the animations of the Friendatrice (previously known as the Cockatrice) to their initial, vastly superior versions.

- A new biome, the Sugarfields, filled to the brim with sweets and candy, such as cotton candy ‚Äòtrees‚Äô, giant candy canes and more - plus a new mob, the Phudge, a neutral, chocolate-y variant of the Phyg, which drops Cocoa Beans and Candy Canes.

- Another new Biome, the Deeper Aether biome, which has some dazzlingly pretty grass, some nice pine-like trees, and a 100% Absolutely New and Never-Before=Seen‚Ñ¢ mob, the Quail‚Ñ¢ which is certainly not just a vanilla Minecraft Chicken with a rainbow color. Definitely not.

- The Crystallium Woods, which is directly based on early versions of the Aether Crystallium addon (now known as Ancient Aether), bringing some of the older versions‚Äô best (and worst) features! Everything from the epic Crystal Gold to the confusing StructuresInTheVoid bug!

With this biome, comes another new structure, the Ancient Ruin, an abandoned building where you can find a chunk of Zanite ore.

**BUT THAT‚ÄôS NOT ALL‚ÄºÔ∏è**

We‚Ñ¢ Also have implemented many other new features! Such as the new in-game currency collectible, Rebux! These coins cam be dropped by most Aether mobs and are very useful, being used for [ERROR : COULD NOT FIND USAGES IN DATABASE] !!

In addition, We‚Ñ¢ have also overhauled the Cloudcaps biome to be closer to its roots, the Moolands. Consequently, it has been renamed the MooCaps, and most blocks and items in the biome have been renamed as well. A few, such as the grass and What-Was-Previously-Called-The-Shimmerstool-But-Is-Now-The-Wackyshroom, have also been retextured.

Yet another thing done in this update was that We‚Ñ¢ overhauled the Phyg and Flying Cow AI, giving them the ability to spread their wings and fly around for the First‚Ñ¢ time in Aether History!

To see the other things in this update, such as specific biome features, We‚Ñ¢ suggest downloading it and trying it out!

However, we must also first mention Our Very Real Sponsor!

This paragraph has been generously sponsored by the Aperture¬ÆÔ∏è Science Home Sentry Turret‚Ñ¢Ô∏è. The Aperture¬ÆÔ∏è Science Home Sentry Turret‚Ñ¢Ô∏è is your #1 go-to brand for military-grade home security, with a sleek and elegant design which will leave intruders barely intact!

### 2.0.7d - 1.20.1
2.0.7d is here! This one has a few small fixes to the previous version.

CHANGELOG:

> Removed the unfinished and disabled-by-default adrenaline shader effects which were causing crashes even with them disabled, these may be re-enabled in the future > [1.20.1] Implemented system from the 1.19.2 version to avoid overlapping music + Added a tag for biomes with the cloud layer in them

### **(V.7.3.4 Changes) (1.20.1 Minecraft)**

##### Misc:

Fixed worldgen deadlock if a horse with an owner UUID is spawned during world generation.

Lowered volume of Cosmic Crystal Entity's laser a bit.

(Forge): Removed a little bit of logspam with Pokecube Pollen Puff Compat.

Increased spawnrate of some structures.

##### Mod Compat:

(Forge): Made Buzzier Bees's Honeycomb Bricks and Chiseled Honeycomb Bricks spawn in Bumblezone caves.

##### Misc:

Fixed MC-268617 with a mixin. This is so people with Modrinth App can play Bumblezone. [https://github.com/modrinth/theseus/issues/1048](https://github.com/modrinth/theseus/issues/1048)

##### Fluids:

(Fabric/Quilt): Backported diagonal textures for Honey Fluid and Royal Jelly Honey Fluid. Forge cannot support this due to lack of API.

(Fabric/Quilt): Added missing translations for knowingEssenceStructureNameServer, knowingEssenceStructureNameClient, disableEssenceBlockShaders, treeDungeonRarity

## Eidolon : Repraised
[CurseForge Link](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/eidolon-repraised)

### Eidolon:Repraised 1.20.1-0.3.8.10
Yet another bugfix update as i have very little time to work on anything. Fixing the nasty progression and config bug that breaks the chant system and required /devotion try-fix for many. Fix ravens and slugs not breeding. Fix dupe bug with research table. Fix summon raven page not showing recipe. Adds tags to allow or deny mobs to be enthralled regardless of undead type Reduced spawnrate of stray towers. You can find a datapack copy of eidolon files on github to use as template to config stuff no more configurable with the classifc configs.

### Eidolon:Repraised 1.20.1-0.3.8.9
Fix decoder issue and chant crash caused by configs, should fix crucible not starting crafting in classic mode, added "devotion tryfix" to force the unlocks if something goes wrong and stages are skipped

### Eidolon_Repraised-1.20.1-0.3.8.8b.jar
Fix music disc playing only for few seconds. [Emery]  
Fix permanent ethereal hearts not generating without an external kickstarter, and reduced default maximum.  
Fix rituals taking the focus item as simple pedestal item and invalidating the ritual midway. Fix few advancements not triggering.  
Reworked angel sight ring to work while CoFH core is present. [coAuth: Siver]  
Blacklist for enchantments that should not show in the soul enchanter [Siver]  
Adds the ars ecclesia to the tags for bookshelves and lecterns.  
Rework signs to work with mods like amendments.  
Move athame foraging results to recipes.  
Adds red candles to valid altar upgrades.  
Adds rituals for Ravens and Slugs  
Adds configs for the chants (pray cooldown, cost, etc.)  
Adds optional mode (configs) for the Crucible that gives a bit more wiggle room to check the recipe between each step, the crucible will keep waiting with a looping timer instead of just failing after the first timer expires.  
NOTE: this is experimental and doesn't mean that you can start the step and adjust your inventory midway, it will probably have more iterations before becoming the default.

The scriptorium is basically not implemented yet, for those wondering. No ETA for backports atm.

### 1.20.1-forge-4.0
walkers 4.0
===========

I'll start with the small changes. If a mob has an Ability but isn't listed in the abilityCooldownMap in the Config, it'll be added to it. Mobs, that are sensitive to water (get hurt by it) also pass this to the player. There are also many more Friends & Foes Abilities. The shape isn't rendered as spectator anymore, too. For 1.20.1 and below, the First Person Model Mod doesn't crash anymore and should work fine with Walkers. Now, let's get to the greatest change: **The SkillSystem**. This allows datapack creators to change the bahavior of mob shapes! There are also some new features, such as The ReinforcementsSkill or the HumanoidSkill. I hope you like it! Of course there are some background improvements and new minor features, too. Special Thanks to Yoananas_gang for supporting the project.

### CarbonConfig-1.20.4-1.2.1
Port to 1.20.4

### CarbonConfig-1.20.2-1.2.1
This is a Major Rewrite of underlying systems and changing how the Parsed Elements work.

The previous implementation for ParsedValues/ParsedArrays was simply to clunky for the users and developers.  
Now the new implementation allows a LOT more features, such as recursion/named variables and more, while being simpler to develop for.

This was done because certain features were simply to hard to implement with it or near impossible which now have more freedom.

This rewrite should automatically upgrade to the new implementation, but in the worst case you might have to delete/regen your carbon config files once and be done with it.  
NOTE: Forge configs are not affected by this. This is just carbon rewrite.

Anyways times for the changelog:

Changelog:  
Version 1.2.1:

*   Added: BuiltIn Minecraft Color/Style support for ColorValue. So its easier to use these things. (Developer only)
*   Added: A simple/expanded color table for the ColorValue Suggestions so a good base color table is provided.
*   Reworked/Added: How multiline configs work. Instead of being in a <> its now within a <<< >>>. Automatic migration included.
*   Reworked/Added: How parsed implementation work. (Breaking change). Which now include Named Variables and a clear format that is easy to use for users and easier to implement for developers.
*   Reworked/Changed: Various graphicsal changes with the Gui itself how elements are displayed and how buttons are.
*   Fixed: Crash that happened due to the regex outputing empty strings which was an unexpected case.
*   Fixed: Entries in the gui get selected when the list was ment to be unselectable

**Changelog:**  
No code changes, but thought this was the best way to reach everyone.  
Windows Defender has had issues this past week with some mods falsely flagging the mod as a "Trojan:Script/Wacatac.B!ml".  
This is a false positive. Microsoft has fixed this in their latest Defender update. The solution is to update Windows Defender's definitions.  
  
This can be done via Windows Update, or alternatively via these steps:  
1. Open command prompt as administrator.  
2. Run the following, without the ‚Äú-quotes:  
  
‚Äúcd C:Program FilesWindows Defender && MpCmdRun.exe -removedefinitions -dynamicsignatures && MpCmdRun.exe -SignatureUpdate‚Äù  
  
That's it! I wish I could do more. I can assure you there is nothing wrong with the mod. Hopefully in a few days Defender be updated automatically for everyone.

## Sophisticated Storage
[CurseForge Link](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sophisticated-storage)

### sophisticatedstorage-1.20.1-0.10.21.793.jar
Updated Russian translation (thanks Fr0stmatic)

Fixed "too many items will spill from this storage when broken" message to show proper storage block names. Also fixed this logic not to cause wooden storages render to lose their wood type / color when block break is stopped with this message  
Fixed dropPacked config setting when on to also not show "too many drops would happen if you break this block" message as all blocks are packed by default and on the contrary made creative player breaking of the blocks

### sophisticatedstorage-1.20.1-0.10.20.778.jar
Fixed dropPacked config setting when on to also not show "too many drops would happen if you break this block" message as all blocks are packed by default also made it so that if this config is on the packed storage drops for creative players as well when the storage has at least some item in it instead of deleting storage including its contents

Also made it so that only either compression or compacting upgrade in storage not both at the same time can be put in storage to prevent world hang issues due to how these two interact Added dropPacked config that when turned on makes all chests / barrels drop packed without the need to use packing tape. By default this config is off

Fixed compression upgrade sometimes not showing slot background when inserted until gui is reopen and fixed max stack size tooltip to properly refresh on client everytime stack upgrade is changed in some way without the need to reopen gui

Fixed compression upgrade to properly update contents of compression slots after recipe updates supporting proper addition / removal of recipes, updating items shown on barrel and proper updates after reload command

Fixed compression config cache for the additional uncompression recipes to refresh when a world is loaded

### sophisticatedstorage-1.20.1-0.10.12.768.jar

Elytra Trims 3.0 - The Doomsday Update
======================================

Update notes
------------

*   In 1.20.5, due to ItemStack changes, converted elytras ****will lose their glow****, all other features will remain. This will be looked into in a future release, but until then you can afford an extra glow ink sac, right?
*   Trimming and dyeing currently can't be disabled on the server side, as it is now controlled by tags.

Elytra preview
--------------

Elytra trims now renders elytra entity model for its item - just like shields, banners and beds do:  
![Item preview 1](https://i.imgur.com/aRNGIhk.png) ![Item preview 2](https://i.imgur.com/1r9WOHE.png)  
If you don't like it - it can be disabled in the mod config. To access it you need [YACL](/linkout?remoteUrl=https%253a%252f%252fmodrinth.com%252fmod%252fyacl) and on Fabric [Mod Menu](/linkout?remoteUrl=https%253a%252f%252fmodrinth.com%252fmod%252fmodmenu). On Forge it is accessible via default mods menu.

Kotlin migration - who asked?
-----------------------------

First of all, I asked. 1.20.5 brought an enormous amount of changes, which was especially bad for Elytra Trims, because it is developed for multiple Minecraft versions. Kotlin provides several ways (such as type aliases, extension and inline functions) that simplify code versioning. So here it is, cope with it.

Texture processing rewrite
--------------------------

Elytra Trims generates textures dynamically to adjust for dozens of trims and now unlimited amount of banner patterns. Since I got more skill in modding and had to look through the entire codebase, this process has been optimised.  
Notably:

*   Elytra model mask is no longer duplicated for each texture pass.
*   Armor trims are now queried from atlas definitions.
*   Texture rendering now extensively uses caching and reports missing textures.

Other changes
-------------

*   `bolt` and `flow` trims have been added, available with 1.21 datapack (@masik16u)
*   [DashLoader](/linkout?remoteUrl=https%253a%252f%252fmodrinth.com%252fmod%252fdashloader) is no longer incompatible
